The string sort routines are contained in a Visual Basic module. The module includes algorithms for Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insert Sort and Selection Sort. However, it is recommended that you use Quick Sort all the time as this 'non-standard' quick sort routine delegates to Insert Sort for small arrays and small chunks.
